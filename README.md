# ucd-csi2312-pa2

//Compiler

For this assignment, I used CLion 1.1 Build #CL-141.2348


//Cluster




//Point




// Everything else

To be honest, it took me awhile to understand what we were trying to achieve here. I finally figured out that we are basically updating PA1 to accept clusters and n points. Here you'll find the completed header files, while I'm completely still working on the three cpp files so those will be partially finished.
